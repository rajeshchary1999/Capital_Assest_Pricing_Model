Project Title
Capital Assest Pricing Model (CAPM) | Amazon

Hi, I'm Rajesh! ðŸ‘‹
1.The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is used to estimate the expected return of an asset based on its risk relative to the overall market.

2.To calculate CAPM, we need to estimate the expected return of the market, the risk-free rate, and the asset's beta coefficient.

3.For our analysis, we used the S&P 500 as a proxy for the market and the 10-year US Treasury bond yield as the risk-free rate.

4.We used a linear regression model (OLS) to estimate the beta coefficient for Amazon's stock based on its daily returns and the returns of the S&P 500.

5.Our results showed that Amazon's beta coefficient was 1.19, indicating that the stock is more volatile than the overall market.

6.Using the estimated market risk premium (the difference between the expected return of the market and the risk-free rate), we calculated Amazon's expected return to be 11.61%.

7.Overall, our analysis suggests that Amazon's stock is fairly priced relative to its risk, based on the CAPM model. However, it's important to note that CAPM has its limitations and should be used in conjunction with other valuation models and analysis.
